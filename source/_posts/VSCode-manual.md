## Workbench

### Easier Display Language configuration ([March 2019 version 1.33](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33))

Running the `Configure Display Language` command will now open a Quick Pick listing the available locales based on the Language Packs you have installed, instead of only opening the locale.json file. When you make a selection, the locale will be automatically updated and you'll be prompted to restart VS Code for the change to take effect.
